Refactor both HTMLs, changing class names, ids, improving readability and removing redundancy.

Change Tooltip structure to the items, in order to make the item list scrollable without having issues
with the overflow. For now, using bigger width without overflow to avoid those problems.

Need to change the size of the content for the champion name, level selection, champion image and skills
in order to improve mobile compatibility, currently overflowing on some resolutions.
Currently when below 450px width, the rightmost border shrinks to the left and, when below 400px, it gets
smaller than the content container.

Add item selection, first visually, doesn't need to worry about mythic items limitations, since in season
14 they are not present. Limitations to amount of items could be done with JS, however is needed to look
for other data providers, such as community dragon, since their Items.json provides max amount limitations.
Link to the JSON: "https://raw.communitydragon.org/latest/plugins/rcp-be-lol-game-data/global/default/v1/items.json"

Check for other data providers to champions and items, such as community dragon, lol wiki (Data can be stracted from
the LUA table they provide), also: "http://cdn.merakianalytics.com/riot/lol/resources/latest/en-US/" can be a good 
provider due to more detailed information for both items and champions, with champion stats more well defined and 
organized.

Improve error treatment on server and on client side.

Add item search.

Separete CSS stylesheets for further readability and code organization.
